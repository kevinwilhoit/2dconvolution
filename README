Project description: 

  The first program, alphamask, takes in the dhouse.png input image, and 
computes an alphamask for it. This sets the alpha values of the green background to 0, 
causing the background to become fully transparent. The program takes in a second filename
and writes out the produced image to it. 
  The second program, composite, takes in the output image from the first program and 
composites the image on top of a background image that is passed in. This is done using the
over operation, and causes the output image of the first program to be placed on top of the
second image passed in. A third filename is accepted, and can be written to by pressing the 
'w' key while the program is running. If you did not pass in a file name to write a final
image to, the program will ask for a name in the terminal window. The 'q' or 'Q' key quits
the program. 
  The file "ranges.txt" contains the ranges for the H, S, and V values that will be used
to calculate the alphamask. 
    -The first line is the H upper value; 
    -The second line is the H lower value;  
    -The third line is the S upper value; 
    -The fourth line is the S lower value;
    -The fifth line is the V upper value; 
    -The sixth line is the V lower value.  


How to run your program:
  make
  "./alphamask filename.ext filename2.ext"
  "./composite filename.ext filename2.ext filename3.ext"
  Examples: "./alphamask dhouse.png output.png" 
            "./composite output.png beach.jpg"
                 or
            "./composite output.png beach.jpg output_final.png"
